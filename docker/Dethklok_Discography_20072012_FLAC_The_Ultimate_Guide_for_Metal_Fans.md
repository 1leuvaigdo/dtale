## The Dethalbum (2007)
  
The Dethalbum is the debut album by Dethklok, released under Peaceville Records in early 2007. This was the first Dethklok album to be recorded live[^1^]. Since the album was recorded live, its design is also different. The album was released with two different covers: one featuring the band members in their animated form, and another featuring them as live-action actors[^1^].
  
The Dethalbum features 20 tracks, including some songs that appeared in the first season of Metalocalypse, such as "Murmaider", "Thunderhorse", "Birthday Dethday", and "Dethharmonic". The album also includes some bonus tracks that were not featured in the show, such as "Duncan Hills Coffee Jingle", "Blood Ocean", and "Hatredy". The album showcases Dethklok's signature style of fast-paced, melodic, and technical death metal, with lyrics that are often humorous, violent, or absurd.
  
## Dethalbum II (2009)
  
Dethalbum II is the second album by Dethklok, released under Williams Street Records in late 2009. This album was produced by Ulrich Wild, who also worked on the first album. Unlike the first album, this one was not recorded live, but rather in a studio with session musicians[^2^]. The album features 12 tracks, most of which appeared in the second season of Metalocalypse.
  
Dethalbum II continues the musical direction of the first album, but with some variations. The songs are more complex, progressive, and diverse, incorporating elements of thrash metal, black metal, doom metal, and symphonic metal. Some of the highlights of the album are "Bloodlines", "Laser Cannon Deth Sentence", "Black Fire Upon Us", and "Murmaider II: The Water God". The album also features guest appearances by musicians such as Gene Hoglan (drums), Mike Keneally (guitar), and Bryan Beller (bass).
  
## Dethalbum III (2012)
  
Dethalbum III is the third album by Dethklok, released under Williams Street Records in late 2012. This album was also produced by Ulrich Wild and features session musicians. The album features 12 tracks, some of which appeared in the third and fourth seasons of Metalocalypse.
  
Dethalbum III is similar to the previous albums in terms of style and quality, but with some new influences. The songs are more melodic, catchy, and atmospheric, with some hints of power metal, folk metal, and industrial metal. Some of the standout tracks are "I Ejaculate Fire", "Crush The Industry", "The Galaxy", and "Rejoin". The album also features guest vocals by Raya Yarbrough on "The Galaxy" and Jack Black on "Impeach God".
  
## The Doomstar Requiem (2013)
  
The Doomstar Requiem is a rock opera by Dethklok, released under BS Records in late 2013.
